                <h2>Problem Description</h2>
                <p>Many people nowadays do not explore literature- or reading-based content, such as newspapers, books, and poetry due to an increasingly technology-dominant world as much as in the past. Plus, many people may find it difficult to find ways or even feel motivated to express themselves and be creative through writing, and no longer take the time to experiment with writing. What many people now do for fun or to take a break from their busy lives may be consuming information rather than creating something or finding ways to express themselves. This is where a blackout poetry app idea comes in.</p>
                <p>Blackout poetry is a type of poetry that uses a piece of any text to create a poem through the selecting of some words while blacking out the rest. Many people do not know about blackout poetry, mainly because it is something done on pen and paper. Creating a platform offering digitalized and interactive blackout poetry would give more people the opportunity to learn about and experiment with this creative activity, and provide it in an interesting way through a medium that many people use everyday.
