                <h2>Problem Description</h2>
                <p>Many people nowadays do not explore literature or reading-based content, such as newspapers, books, and poetry due to an increasingly technology-dominant world as much as in the past. Plus, many people may find it difficult to find ways or even feel motivated to express themselves and be creative through writing, and no longer take the time to experiment with writing. What many people now do for fun or to take a break from their busy lives may be consuming information rather than creating something or finding ways to express themselves. This is where a blackout poetry app idea comes in.</p>
                <p>Blackout poetry is a type of poetry that uses a piece of any text to create a poem through the selecting of some words while blacking out the rest. Many people do not know about blackout poetry, mainly because it is something done on pen and paper. Creating a platform offering digitalized and interactive blackout poetry would give more people the opportunity to learn about and experiment with this creative activity, and provide it in an interesting way through a medium that many people use everyday.</p>

                <h2>App Description</h2>
                <p>This web application is developed around the norms of self-expression and articulateness of an individual. Our target user base is a wide array of people interested in poetry, wordplay, and problem-solving. Additionally, our application will be developed around a cyclic circulation system of both generic inferences and end-user-shared verses. This online sharing system will create a digital environment where each and every user can leave their inputs without any discrimination. </p>
                <p>Initially, users will be welcomed with a modern-dated home page, where they can access arbitrary and other user-entered blackout poetry (that is pre-loaded in the system), or go to a textbox where they can provide their own custom text entry that can be converted to blackout poetry. Additionally, when the user will input his/her own custom verse they will have to choose to upload it to our database for other users to take a stab at it. They will be asked to fill out a quick pop-up survey about their text entry to help other users use a search and filter feature over our database. In the context of the rubric, we are considering the blackout of text and the addition of custom verses to our databases as the two major significant features. On the other hand, the search and filter over the database will act as a minor significant feature for our web application. </p>
                <p>We will be inheriting data from a list of prefix black-out poetries and referencing the functioning from a similar project. We wonâ€™t require a lot of pre-loaded verses as the database will grow as more users use the application. As evident, in the current era of modernization and digitization there is a clear lack of literature exploration and self expression. Our application will act as a tool for our userbase to explore literature or reading-based content, such as newspapers, books, and poetry due to an increasingly technology-dominant world. Additionally, what several users do for recreation may be consuming information rather than producing information or finding ways to express themselves on a streamlined platform. </p>
