            </header>
            <p>Dating back to the 18th century, blackout poetry, also known as redacted poetry, is a unique form of poetry where one takes any piece of text from any source, such as a newspaper article or old book, and "blacks out" some words while leaving untouched only the ones they desire to keep in their poem. The result is often a visually pleasing piece of contrastive art while simultaneously rendering an interesting poem using words already in the given text, both limiting the poet to what they can write but also allowing them to combine words in a way that has never been done before.</p>
